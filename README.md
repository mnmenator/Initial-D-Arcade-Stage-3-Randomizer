# Initial-D-Arcade-Stage-3-Randomizer

This is a randomizer I made for Initial D Arcade Stage Version 3. It will randomly assign you a car, track, all track attributes, and song.

## Probabilities

### Cars

Each car has an equal chance of being selected, including the secret Impreza that Bunta drives.

### Tracks

The probabilies of the tracks reflects my personal preferences, and as such not every track has an equal chance of being selected.  
**Myogi:** 7%  
**Usui:** 10%  
**Irohazaka:** 5%  
**All others:** 13%

### Songs

Each song has an equal chance of being selected.

### Track Conditions

Again, the probabilities here reflect my personal preferences.  
**Direction:** 50/50 between whatever two options are appropriate for the track.  
**Conditions:** 75/25 between Dry and Wet respectively.  
**Time:** 50/50 between Day and Night.
